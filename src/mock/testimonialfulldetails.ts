          In 2017, Blockchain was a fresh ecosystem with not so many sophisticated tools and knowledge artifacts available. It needed a lot of patience to research, \
          investigate and implement the solution. Darshan was always up for it. I wish him good luck. I am sure he will be an asset to any team that he works with and will \
          always be a Go-to employee for his manager. ",
